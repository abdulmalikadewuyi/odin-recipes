        <p>I came up with these Mexican chicken burgers because my husband and I are trying to add more variety to our diets, and cut back on red meat — and they are delish! I used my George Foreman grill to cook them. </p>
        <p>spicy baked sweet potato fries found on Allrecipes. They make a nice substitution for a regular cheeseburger and fries</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
            <li>½ small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>½ (1 ounce) package dry taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>4 wheat hamburger buns, toasted </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the outdoor grill to medium-high heat. Lightly oil the grill grate, and position it about 4 inches from the heat source.  </li>
            <li>Mix ground chicken, onion, garlic, taco seasoning, and egg together in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide chicken mixture evenly and form into 4 soft patties.  </li>
            <li>Cook chicken patties on the preheated grill until meat is no longer pink and juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes per side, depending on thickness. To serve, place each patty on one half of a hamburger bun, top with a slice of cheese, avocado slices, and desired amounts of jalapeño peppers and salsa. Cover with remaining half of bun. </li>
        </ol>
